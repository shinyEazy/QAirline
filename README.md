## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js and npm (for the frontend)
* Python 3.11+ (for the backend)
* Docker and Docker Compose

### Steps

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/QAirline.git
cd QAirline
```

#### Setup Frontend

Navigate to the frontend folder and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Setup Backend

Navigate to the backend folder and run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The backend will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API and Backend

The backend exposes RESTful APIs for:

- **Flight Management**: Manage flight schedules, routes, and available seats.
- **Passenger Booking**: Create, update, and delete flight reservations.
- **Airplane and Airport Details**: Manage airplane models, capacities, and airport information.

### API Documentation

Once the backend server is running, access Swagger UI for API documentation at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

The Swagger UI provides an interactive interface for exploring and testing the API endpoints.

---

## Project Highlights

- **Type-Safe Development**: The frontend uses TypeScript to catch errors early in the development process, improving maintainability and scalability.
- **Modular Design**: The application follows a component-based architecture, allowing for reusable and maintainable code.
- **High Performance**: FastAPI ensures low latency and fast response times for API requests.
- **Scalable**: The backend is designed with scalability in mind, making it easier to extend functionality as the application grows.

---

## Code Standards

### Frontend

- Use **React functional components** and **hooks** for building user interface components.
- 
### Backend

- Follow **FastAPI conventions** for defining API routes and services.
- Ensure **secure API access** with proper input validation and session management to protect user data.

### Documentation

- Keep code well-documented with **comments** and **README updates** to provide clarity to future developers.
- Ensure **proper API documentation** is available using tools like Swagger UI.
